## algorithmic walk

heres the directions fot]r my walk:

Walk outside house

Turn Left towards intersection. 

Repeat 10 times or until made way back home: roll die at intersection.

If you made it back home, reward self with take out.
If you end up lost, roll die: 1,2 = cry; 3,4 = call Uber; 5,6 = try to survive;

RANDOM: At intersection, roll die. 
- If two way intersection and cannot continue straight: 1,2,3 = left; 4,5,6 = right;
- If two way intersection and can continue straight: 1,2,3 = straight; 4,5,6 = left/right;
- If three way intersection: 1,2 = left; 3,4 = straight; 5,6 = right;

If you reach a dead end, turn around and head back to last intersection.
- Roll die again, using same rules but cancel out the roads you have already taken.
