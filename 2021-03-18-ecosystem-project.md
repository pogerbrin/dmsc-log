## Ecosystem Project

For my ecosystem project, I had trouble figuring out how I would be able to add a force such as mud or water to slow down the creatures, so for now I just messed with gravititatoinal forces. I used code from Dan Schiffman as my base, and then tried to change it up a bit, with my own images and altered the forces a bit. One thing I tried to do was make an array of the attractors so that the flies would change which apple they would be attarcted to when flying around, but I couldn't figure out exactly how to make it work. I feel like theres something I'm missing, so this weekend I'm going to go over the first two chapters of The Nature of Code again so I can hopefully make this work out the way I intend it too. 

Something I would like to add is having the mouse act as a flyswatter as a way to implement the "decay" factor into the project. I'm not actually sure how I would be able to implement a force to slow down my flies in this current project, since they'll be flying around. Maybe I'll change things up? 

## Livecoding Practice with Estuary

For my livecoding session using MiniTidal in Estuary, I teamed up with Kasey, Monty, Jacob, Ishan and Christa to jam out for a bit. Heres a video that Jacob recorded for us:
