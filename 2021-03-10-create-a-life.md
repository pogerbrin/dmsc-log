This creature (or these creatures) demonstrate(s) emergence in that all of them moving around past each other at this small level, lets us appear to see them interacting on our screen as if they were real. We have all seen a group of flies or gnats in one area, buzzing and flying around each other as if there were endless amounts of them. The replication of this situation with the programmed flies creates the emergence for this. 


# Examples of A-life

Kindling is a game that was actually created by a good friend of mine and a few of his other friends that they had made for a game jam weekend! The little deer-like characters in this game interact with each other by working together to collect resources to help themselves be rescused from nearby boats. This, from my understanding, would be an example of emergence, as these systems these creatures have help them and help us get them to safety.

Seaman is an old SEGA Dreamcast game that is considered to be a unique video game in that it presents limited action. The player's role is to feed and care for Seaman, the fish pet creature with a human face, while providing him with the company that he needs. In fact, the player is required to check on the Seaman every day of real-time, or he could die. A portion of Seaman's knowledge is random trivia. When he asks what the player's birthday is (and the player responds via the microphone input), Seaman will then share significant events that happened on that date. The emergence of this game would be that the player wants to keep Seaman alive in order to beat the game, and Seaman, the a-life, will provide entertainment to the player and eat food given by the player. With this collaboration between Seaman and the player, they will both win, as Seaman will live and the player will have the satisfaction of beating the game. 

# what emergence means to me

To me, emergence is how the a-life and the player/person interacting with the a-life interact with one another, and how well they work togther to reach a goal. The a-life has its functions, but some of it's functions cannot be done without the help from a person, and the person might not be able to help the a-life in a certain way until other ways have been done.
