## messing around with hydra

I think Hydra is a great and intuitive program! Part of me wishes that we worked on this before Estuary/MiniTidal because I feel like this is a much easier grasp on live coding. The language is quite simple, but there is so much you can do with it to make it complicated. I like to make very colorful and mesmerizing pieces, like optical illusions. The kaleid() function makes that pretty simple to do. Using the src() function was definitely interesting too. I thought the webcam option for it was pretty cool lol. 

I certainly think Hydra is much easier compared to p5.js, they are not even on the same level to me. There is so much in p5.js that it can easily become confusing and overwhelming, but Hydra is quite simple to follow. If you want to create something visually engaging quickly and easily, then Hydra is definitely the way to go. But if you want something a bit more complicated and custom to you, then p5.js is what you should use. Hydra kinda feels more like playing with code someone already made, but p5.js is where you code most of the functions yourself.

For this piece, I used my Webcam. Unfortunately, my webcam sucks and so does the lighting in my room, so it can be hard to tell where I am. I mean, I am in multiple places, but if anyone wants to try it out on their own, heres the [link!](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/?code=czAuaW5pdENhbSgpJTBBc3JjKHMwKS5sYXllcihvc2MoMjAlMkMlMjAuMSUyQyUyMDE1KS5yb3RhdGUoMSkubHVtYSgpKS5yZXBlYXRYKDMlMkMwKS5yZXBlYXRZKDMlMkMlMjAwKS5rYWxlaWQoMykubWFzaygodm9yb25vaSgzMCUyQy41JTJDLjEpLmNvbG9yKDQlMkMxJTJDNykuYnJpZ2h0bmVzcygwLjE1KSkucGl4ZWxhdGUoNTAwJTJDNTAwKSkub3V0KCk=)
