This creature (or these creatures) demonstrate(s) emergence in that all of them moving around past each other at this small level, lets us appear to see them interacting on our screen as if they were real. We have all seen a group of flies or gnats in one area, buzzing and flying around each other as if there were endless amounts of them. The replication of this situation with the programmed flies creates the emergence for this. 


# Examples of A-life

Kindling is a game that was actually created by a good friend of mine and a few of his other friends that they had made for a game jam weekend! The little deer-like characters in this game interact with each other by working together to collect resources to help themselves be rescused from nearby boats. This, from my understanding, would be an example of emergence, as these systems these creatures have help them and help us get them to safety.
