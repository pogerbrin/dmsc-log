## some pics from logo

Today, we started working with LOGO, a programming language from the 60s that was created for children and educational purposes in mind. Compared to other languages I have worked with in the past (Processing, HTML, CSS, etc.), this feels like the most simple and basic language I have worked with. 
With LOGO, at first I tried to create an image of a cat’s face, but quickly dropped the idea after messing up the first part I started with - the nose. Unfortunately I did not save a screenshot of it, but I don’t think anyone would have been able to tell it was a cat anyway. So after that, I was just messing with all of the commands I could think to use. I tried switching the pen colors to see every possible option. I was also messing around with the repeat function and just created images with these random lines and colors.
